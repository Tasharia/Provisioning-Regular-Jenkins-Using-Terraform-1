# terraform-for-advanced-class-
This is a project where you will be able to provision a jenkins EC2 server using terraform.  
You will be able to run scripts using terraform that will install jenkins EC2 server, install Apache Maven, Install Docker.io, Install git and also the Kubectl. 
You will use the blue ocen container method to install jenkins. 

Thank 

Josh
